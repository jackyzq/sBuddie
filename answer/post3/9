In spiral model, we can easily adjust the software development with the required changes. The prototypes which are created in every stage, enables us to roll back only a few steps. As soon as any new changes are requested or required we can start up from the last left over prototype version. Whereas, Waterfall model the stages are executed under a sequential flow. Every new phase is processed only after completing the previous phase. This is a big reason why any sudden changes are very hard to accommodate under Waterfall model.  Again, simply because of the sequential nature of the waterfall model if a bug is found or an error is incurred for a preliminary reason, we need to start from the scratch again. Whereas, under spiral model every prototype is tried and tested and hence the chances of find errors at later stages are very rare.
