The vertexes in Dijkstra’s algorithm contain the whole information of a network. There is no such thing that every vertex only cares about itself and its neighbors. On the other hand, Bellman-Ford algorithm’s nodescontain only the information that are related to. This information allows that node just to know about which neighbor nodes can it connect and the node that the relation come from, mutually. Dijkstra’s algorithm is faster than Bellman-Ford’s algorithm however the second algorithm can be more useful to solve some problems, such as negative weights of paths.
